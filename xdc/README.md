# XDC Files
This folder contains XDC files for the GCD and Fibonacci examples. 

The XDC files are designed for the [Basys 3](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start) FPGA board. 
Inputs are expected to come from the [4-button PMOD header](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-btn-4-user-pushbuttons/) inserted
in the lower row of the JB-ports on the FPGA.
